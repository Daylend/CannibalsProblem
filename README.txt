Problem: Missionaries vs Cannibals
Instructions: Run Cannibals.py with python 3.6, no arguments required.

Hello! This program attempts to solve the missionaries vs cannibals problem.
I have implemented a BFS algorithm to find all possible moves that do not result in repeats or losing the game.
It's quite straightforward.
However, I did have problems with formatting the solution properly. As you can see, it outputs every move attempted
until a solution is found. So it works, it's just not pretty. I need more practice with Python.

Enjoy!
